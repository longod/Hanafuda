# Hanafuda: Akaviri Playing Cards

This mod allows you to play game (`Koi-Koi`) using `Hanafuda` with MWSE in Morrowind.  
`Hanafuda` is traditional Japanese playing cards and `Koi-Koi` is one of its game rules, but in-game treats them as card games brought by [Akavir](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Akavir) and it will aim to make them lore-friendly.

## How to play
- This is where `Data Files` is located.
- You can play against NPCs from the service menu by talking to them.
- Or the game can be played instantly by pressing K key. Exit is also K key.
   - You need to enable Debug Mode from mcm.
   - This can also be called from the main menu.
- The game rule is `Koi-Koi` only.
- For information on `Hanafuda` and `Koi-Koi`, please refer to the following documents and others.
